         <!-- Paragraph One: Describing a genre of music -->
         <p><strong>Jazz</strong> is a genre that originated in the African-American communities of New Orleans in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It is characterized by <u>improvisation</u>, syncopation, and usually a regular or forceful rhythm. What makes jazz stand out from other genres is its emphasis on live performances, where each performance can be a unique musical expression.</p>

        <em>Louis Armstrong</em>, a legendary figure in jazz, was known for his distinctive voice and virtuosic trumpet playing. Armstrong helped popularize jazz around the world, with hits like "What a Wonderful World." His contributions have left an indelible mark on both <strong>jazz</strong> and popular music.
